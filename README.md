## Avery's ePortfolio

Welcome to Avery's ePortfolio! This ePortfolio contains content related to the enhancement of three computer programs I have developed during my studies at Southern New Hampshire University. These enhancements focus on improvements in software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database management.

### Informal Code Review.

In this informal code review, three distinct program artifacts are examined and critiqued in terms of their current functionality. The code for each artifact is analyzed in detail and then the planned enhancement for each program is discussed. This code review has been completed for the CS-499 Capstone Project ePortfolio for SNHU's Computer Science program.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/averylutz123/averylutz123.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
