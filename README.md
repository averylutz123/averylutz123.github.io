# Avery's ePortfolio

Welcome to Avery's ePortfolio. This ePortfolio contains three enhanced computer programs that I originally developed during my four years in Southern New Hampshire University's computer science program. These enhancements focus on exmeplifying my skills in software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database management. Additionally, this ePortfolio contains an informal narrated code review and a professional self-assesment that discusses my experience in SNHU's computer science program and my artifact selections. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy my work.

## 1. Proffesional Self-Assesmenet

## 2. Informal Code Review.

In this informal code review, the three artifacts that were selected for enhancmet are examined and critiqued in terms of their current functionality, organization, and complexity. The code for each artifact is analyzed in detail in order to ensure that areas for improvement are highlighted. Then the planned enhancement for each program is discussed. This code review is approximately forty minutes in length.
